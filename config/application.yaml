# IMPORTANT:
# This file contains the default configuration values of the server.
# Modifications to this file should be handled with care. They maybe
# lost the next time the application is updated and create a security
# risk by exposing the shared secret.

# RECOMMENDATION:
# All configuration values/overrides should be done via the environment as
# opposed to modifying the configs. This particularly applies to the required
# keys which must be set before the application has started

# EXAMPLE:
# To set the shared secret in the environment:
# export jwt_shared_secret=...Your shared secret ...
# export ... All the other REQUIRED configs ...

# REQUIRED:
# jwt_shared_secret:  # [REQUIRED]
# app_base_url:       # [REQUIRED]

# DYNAMIC DEFAULTS:
# The following have defaults relative to where the application has been installed
# topology_config:  <install-dir>/config/topology.yaml

# STATIC DEFAULTS:

# DEVELOPERS ONLY:
test:
  jwt_shared_secret:        SOME_TEST_TOKEN
